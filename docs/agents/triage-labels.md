# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles, plus the
local completion role, to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |
| Local completion role      | `completed`          | Implementation and verification finished |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label
string from this table. Use `completed` only after the issue's acceptance checks pass.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
